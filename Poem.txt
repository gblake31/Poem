Roses are Red
Violets are Blue
Beautiful is the 'thank you'
Wrapped with gratitude,

Offered to peace prone people
Who offer what is real-themselves
To nurse with love and humility
and lift them out of hell.

Beautiful is the moment
when sunlit world fades away
And with it mind made mirror
While look inward drawn, toward the new day.
